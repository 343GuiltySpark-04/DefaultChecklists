Retro Seq Button - DEPRESS\r\n\tc. or Fire the retros manually\r\n\r\n2. If conditions permit:\r\n\ta. Select recovery area.\r\n\tb. Compute retrograde time.\r\n\tc. If time permits, reset retrograde clock.\r\n\td. If there is insufficient time, 30 seconds before\r\n\t   retrograde time, Retro Seq button - DEPRESS\r\n\te. or Fire the retros manually\r\n\r\n3. Complete normal recovery procedures\r\n\r\n\r\nSTABILIZATION SYSTEM EMERGENCY OPERATION\r\n\r\nFailure of Automatic Mode\r\nIf the automatic mode fails and the capsule is tumbling,\r\nswitch to Rate Command to stop the tumbling and use\r\nmanual control to return the capsule to desired attitude\r\n\r\n1. Use rate command to stop any tumbling.\r\n\ta. Manual fuel handle - PUSH RATE COMD\r\n\tb. RSCS switch - RATE COMD\r\n\tc. Stop tumbling\r\n\td. Reposition capsule to orbit attitude\r\n\r\n2. Switch to manual mode.\r\n\ta. Manual fuel handle - PULL DIRECT\r\n\tb. ASCS switch - AUX DAMP\r\n\tc. If ASCS damping is desired, RSCS switch - AUTO\r\n\r\n3. Auto control fuel gauge - CHECK\r\n\r\nFailure of Fly-By-Wire\r\nFailure of fly-by-wire may occur in conjunction with failure\r\nof the automatic mode. If it occurs without failure of the\r\nautomatic mode, there is probably an electrical malfunction\r\nin the control system fly-by-wire switches, ASCS switch, or\r\nassociated circuits. Return to automatic mode, unless it\r\nhas also failed, or switch to manual mode.\r\n1. Auto control fuel gauge - CHECK\r\n2. ASCS switch - NORM\r\n3. If the automatic mode also has failed,\r\n\tmanual control fuel handle - PULL DIRECT\r\n4. Use hand controller as necessary to maintain proper attitude\r\n\r\nFailure of Rate Command\r\nIf rate command fails in orbit, switch to manual or fly-by-wire\r\nmode if manual control is desired, or to automatic mode.\r\nDuring retrograde, have manual control fuel handle pulled and\r\nbe prepared to switch to manual AND fly-by-wire if the\r\nautomatic mode also fails.\r\n1. Manual control fuel handle - PULL DIRECT\r\n2. RSCS switch - AUTO\r\n3. ASCS switch - AS DESIRED\r\n\tSwitch to normal, aux-damp, of fly-by-wire as\r\n\tdesired.\r\n\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT CONTROL SYSTEM EMERGENCY OPERATION\r\n\r\nCabin Pressurization\r\n\r\nIn the event the cabin becomes depressurized, it is only\r\nnecessary to have the faceplate closed (automatic in Reentry).\r\nThe cabin may be depressurized to eliminate smoke, fumes, or fire.\r\nThe cabin can be depressurized at any time as long as the \r\nfaceplate is closed.\r\n\r\nIn the event of cabin depressurization, cabin oxygen flow will\r\nautomatically be shut off when cabin pressure drops to\r\napproximately 4.0 psia. The remaining oxygen can be lost\r\noverboard if the cabin is leaking and the cabin pressure remains\r\nabove 4.0 psi. Therefore, depressurize the cabin if a leak is\r\ndiscovered or if oxygen consumption is excessive. If the cabin\r\nwas depressurized by pulling the Decomp \"T\" handle, the \r\ncabin can be pressurized by pushing the handle IN and pulling\r\nRepress \"T\" handle. This will pressurize the cabin in 5 minutes\r\nor less and consume O2 from the active bottle. When the cabin\r\npressure reaches 5 psi, push Repress \"T\" handle IN.\r\n\r\nCabin Depressurization\r\n1. Decomp \"T\" handle - PULL\r\n2. Monitor cabin pressure\r\n\r\nCabin Depressurization\r\n1. Decomp \"T\" handle - PUSH\r\n2. Repress \"T\" handle - PULL\r\n3. Monitor cabin pressure.\r\n\tAt 5 psi cabin pressure, Repress \"T\" handle - PUSH\r\n\r\nEmergency Oxygen\r\nIn the event the suit pressure drops below 4.0, the\r\nemergency oxygen rate valve automatically opens and the\r\nsuit circuit shutoff valve closes to prevent oxygen flow\r\nthrough the impurity removers, temperature control units,\r\nand the suit fans. The emergency oxygen rate valve may be\r\nopened at any time by actuating the Emer O2 lever on the right\r\nconsole. This action supplies oxygen for cooling and pressurizing\r\nthe suit as well as supplying oxygen for breathing. The \r\n\"O2 Emer. Flow\" light will illuminate whenever the emergency\r\noxygen rate valve of suit circuit shutoff valve operates\r\nmanually or automatically. During emergency rate operation,\r\nthe oxygen supply duration is greatly reduced because oxygen\r\nis exhausted overboard.\r\n\r\n1. To transfer to emergency oxygen:\r\n\tEmer O2 lever - EMER\r\n2. To return to normal operation:\r\n\ta. Emer O2 lever - NORM\r\n\tb. Suit Fan switch - NORM\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternate Suit Fan\r\nIf the No. 1 suit fan fails with the Suit Fan switch in the\r\nNORM position, the No. 2 fan will automatically cut in to\r\nprovide suit ventilation. Either fan may also be selected by\r\nplacing the Suit Fan switch in the No. 1 or No. 2 position.\r\nIf the No. 1 fan fails, and the No. 2 fan does not cut in\r\nautomatically, place the Suit Fan switch in the No. 1 position,\r\nand the suit Fan fuse in the No. 2 position. If No. 1 fan\r\noperation is not regained, placing the Suit Fan switch in the\r\nNo. 2 position will energize the No.2 Fan direct, circumventing\r\nthe fuse switch. If it is impossible to regain suit fan operation,\r\nactuate the Emer O2 lever on the right console to provide\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nIf the No. 1 suit fan fails and No. 2 does not switch in\r\nautomatically:\r\n1. Suit Fan switch - NO. 1\r\n2. Suit Fan fuse switch - NO. 2\r\n3. If NO. 1 fan remains inoperative:\r\n\tSuit Fan switch - NO. 2\r\n4. If NO. 2 fan is inoperative, Emer O2 lever - EMER\r\n\r\n\t\tWARNING\r\n\tSuit ventilation, either by fan or by emergency\r\n\toxygen, must not be lost for more than 30 seconds\r\n\tor CO2 buildup in the helper will become dangerously\r\n\thigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL SYSTEM EMERGENCY OPERATION\r\n\r\nMain Battery Failure\r\nFailures on one or more main batteries may be detected by\r\nperiodically checking voltage of each battery every\r\n30 seconds. If any battery shows less than 18 volts,\r\nturn that battery off.\r\n\r\n1. If any battery is below 18 volts turn that battery OFF\r\n2. If Main Bus voltage is below 18 volts:\r\n\ta. Check all bus and battery voltages\r\n\tb. Turn off all low priority equipment\r\n\r\n\r\nStandby Battery Failure\r\nThe only indication of standby battery failure will be by\r\nperiodic checks. If Standby battery failure is detected, turn\r\nthat battery off. If the main batteries also fail, place the\r\nAudio Bus switch to EMER to permit the isolated battery to\r\nmaintain communications. The isolated battery also supplies\r\nthe isolated squib bus to assure sufficient power to fire all\r\nsquibs as well as the retrograde rockets. The isolated battery\r\nmay also be connected to the main bus through the Standby Battery\r\nswitch if the Isolated Battery switch is placed in the\r\nSTBY position.\r\n\r\nIf standby battery failure is detected:\r\n1. Failed Battery switch - OFF\r\n2. Check voltage of main and isolated batteries.\r\n3. If main batteries are low, shut off all non-essential\r\n\tequipment.\r\n\r\nIf the main batteries also fail:\r\n4. If radios are needed, Audio Bus switch - EMER\r\n5. If main bus power is needed:\r\n\ta. Isol Btry switch - STBY\r\n\tb. Stby Btry switch - ON\r\n\r\n\t\tWARNING\r\n\tThe isolated battery should not be used to\r\n\tsupply other busses unless absolutely necessary\r\n\tand then only for essential equipment since it\r\n\tsupplies the alternate power source for firing\r\n\tretrograde rockets and the recovery system\r\n\tpyrotechnics.\r\n\r\nIsolated Battery Failure\r\nIf the isolated battery fails, the isolated squib bus can be\r\npowered from the standby battery by placing the Isol Btry\r\nswitch to STDBY. Immediate retrograde is not necessary\r\nunless the main batteries are also low.\r\n\r\n1. Isol Btry switch - STBY\r\n2. Check all battery voltages.\r\n3. Before retrograde\r\n\tIsol Btry switch - STDBY\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete Electrical Failure\r\nFailure of the ammeter or the Ammeter switch can cause\r\ncomplete electrical failure by removing the ground for\r\nall capsule batteries. If all capsule power is suddenly\r\nlost, place the Ammeter switch to BYPASS to provide an\r\nalternate ground for the batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nInverter Failure\r\nIf either main inverter fails with both AC Bus switches in the\r\nNORM position, the standby inverter will automatically supply\r\npower to the failed AC bus and illuminate the \"STBY AC Auto\"\r\nlight. Determine which inverter failed by placing the \r\nASCS AC Bus switch to STBY and monitoring the Standby AC Auto\r\ntelelight. If the light goes out, the ASCS bus inverter has\r\nfailed. Leave the ASCS AC Bus switch in STBY if ASCS inverter\r\nhas failed; if not, return the switch to NORM, and place the\r\nFans AC Bus switch in the STBY position. This provides\r\nfor illumination of the Standby AC Auto telelight if the\r\nremaining inverter should fail.\r\n\r\nWhen STBY AC Auto light illuminates and it is desired to\r\ndetermine which inverter has failed, observe the following\r\nprocedure:\r\n1. ASCS AC Bus switch - STBY\r\n2. If STBY AC Auto telelight goes out, ASCS inverter has\r\n\tfailed. Leave the ASCS AC Bus switch in the STBY\r\n\tposition so that failure of the Fans AC Inverter\r\n\tmay be detected by re-illumination of the \r\n\tSTBY AC Auto light.\r\n3. If STBY AC Auto telelight remains illuminated, Fans\r\n\tinverter has failed. Place the ASCS AC Bus switch\r\n\tin NORM, and Fans AC Bus switch in STBY. STBY\r\n\tAC Auto light should go out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM EMERGENCY OPERATION\r\nIf no voice or radio messages can be sent or received,\r\none of the available communication systems may have \r\nfailed.\r\n1. Check position of capsule relative to ground station.\r\n\tCapsule may be out of range of all ground stations.\r\n2. Check operations of UHF Hi and Hi freq, and HF systems.\r\n3. Audio Bus switch - EMER will connect the Audio Bus\r\n\tto the Isolated Battery\r\n\r\n\t\tWARNING\r\n\tDo not place the audio bus to EMER unless it is\r\n\tabsolutely necessary because of the excessive drain\r\n\ton the isolated battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE OR FUMES\r\nAny fire inside the capsule will probably be an electrical fire.\r\nTherefore, attempt to determine the cause of the fire and turn\r\noff the affected equipment. The cabin can be depressurized\r\nto extinguish any fire and eliminate fumes.\r\n\r\n1. If fire or fumes are severe, Decomp \"T\" handle - PULL\r\n2. Attempt to determine the source of fire or fumes\r\n3. If source of fire or fumes can be determined, turn off\r\n\taffected equipment.\r\n4. If affected equipment can be turned off, repressurize\r\n\tcabin.\r\n5. Initiate retrograde as soon as convenient.\n\n"
